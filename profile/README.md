  <h1>AmetrineOS</h1>
</div>
A custom, work in progress Arch Linux fork meant to give the feel of Arch Linux while being more accessible to newer users. This is very work in progress, and while we work on this, consider checking out <a href='https://endeavouros.com/'>EndeavourOS</a>.

  <h1>Why was this made?</h1>
</div>
This project was started by Endercass to learn how to make an installer for Arch Linux on a custom image. This quickly became a much larger project, and there are plans in the future to help this mature in to something more than just another Arch fork.
